How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff -u game_new.js game_old.js

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can have a look at what the changes are and would make it easier to do the next coding task easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    1.we can commit when we think it is correct time to commit a change
    2.we can have the control of the content of a commit so that we can select when to commit a change
    
    Cons:
    1.if we forget committing a change, then it would be difficult for us to understand the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git has a feature of saving the changes of multiple files related to a change to a single commit so that it would be a single change  for a feature

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using the command 'git log' shows us different commits in the git repository.
    And then using the command git diff allowance s us to view difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control, we can go to the previous commit that was working fine if we had messed the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use the git for versioning my projects and then change them accordingly and track the changes.
