When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When we want to share our work with different people working on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It is because we need to know when each of the different users who are operating on the files had their changes done and that we can pull the changes when they are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	We use forks when we are about to modify a repository of some other author so that we won't be disturbing their code.
	We use clone when we are modifying the repository if an author if he is willing us to do so.
	We use branch when we do not want to disturb the branch that is originally working and that we want to experiment on the branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Having a last known state of the remote stored locally, would help us in knowing if we were having the state as of the remote after some time.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	without git, or GitHub, I would have different instances of files each time I make changes to the files and ask others how it was by mailing them the changed files .
